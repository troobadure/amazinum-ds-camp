    "Since we are getting multiple possible pairs of numbers, then this task cannot be logically completed and there is no right solution for these particular conditions. BUT! If we cut down our set of available sums so they cannot reach 69 + 96 = 162 (a + b < 162), then all the solutions except first one will not be available. So in that case the task will be solvable and such dialog will make sence. In fact, it turns out the classical version of this problem has a restriction that says a + b < 100. It's dated 1969 and is called [Impossible Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_and_Product_Puzzle) or Freudenthal Problem. Nice!"
